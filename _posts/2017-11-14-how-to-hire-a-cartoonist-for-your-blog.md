I had about 8,000 words of text. There were a few tables (ooh, exciting tables!) and screenshots to break it up, but mostly it was a giant wall of text.

I had recently seen [The Book of Bad Arguments](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND)

# Working with a cartoonist


It's fun! I get to pretend to be a cartoonist. I learned with my TaskRabbit chef that I enjoy cooking when I don't have to cook. I enjoy making cartoons when I don't have to draw.

# Cost

Compare it to searching for and paying for a stock image. Compare it to the time it takes you to promote the article.

# Tips
Below, I've compiled tips for hiring and working with cartoonists based on my own experience and interviews with the cartoonists I worked with.

## Attract quality artists

Bad ratings are very damaging to any freelancer's business. The artists are looking for clients who have reasonable expectations and will treat them with respect.

Christine mentioned that a client once began an invitation to apply to a job with, "HEY, YOU. YES, YOU!" If a software recruiter contacted me with a message that began that way, I'd delete their email immediately.

## Start with a small job

First, you should pay just because it's respectful.

When you expect free samples, you drive away quality artists.

## Write a clear, thorough job description

What size do you need? Do you want just the final images or do you want the raw files as well in case you need to make edits later?


## Consider total cost


## Choose the right contract type for the job

If you have a very firm

If it's loose, pay by the hour.

## Give attribution

While none of the artists I spoke with said they strictly require it, they all agreed that it was standard to give attribution

## No backsies

Once you accept the work, that's it.
