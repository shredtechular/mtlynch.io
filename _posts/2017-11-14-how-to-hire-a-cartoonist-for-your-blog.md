I had about 8,000 words of text. There were a few tables (ooh, exciting tables!) and screenshots to break it up, but mostly it was a giant wall of text.

I had recently seen an illustrated guide to logical fallacies called [*An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments*](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND). I loved it. It presented dry, academic ideas in a fun, engaging way. I wanted to use cartoons in a similar way to liven up my article.

# Process
This article is based on my experience of hiring and working with a cartoonist. 

# Writing the job posting

I posted [a job listing](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01069b65ac37524889) on Upwork, a site I use frequently for hiring freelancers:


# Hiring Round 1: Choosing cartoonists to shortlist

I received 13 submissions and reduced it to a shortlist of four.

Interestingly, all four applicants in the shortlist were women, even though only 5/13 applicants were female. I'm not sure about cartoonists in general, but within my applicant pool, female cartoonists had a style more consistent with children's books. Male cartoonists had a style aimed at adults, such as graphic novels or webcomics.

The four

* [Christine Elefsiniotis](https://www.facebook.com/christinaillustration/)
* [Loraine Yow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lolo-ology/)
* [Manel Sto Nino](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0146ddb5612a5aaaca)
* Sofia (she preferred I not link to her profile for this article)

# Hiring Round 2: Choosing the final cartoonist

Once I had a shortlist, I commissioned each of them to draw a cartoon based on the same description.

>I would like an illustration of two animals. One of the characters is straining to move a couch, carrying it on their back. The other is watching the first character and not helping, but the character says, "We should really move this couch."

I also linked to the [relevant section](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews/#never-use-the-word-you) of the blog post to give the cartoonists additional context into the idea.

## Sofia's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from Sofia" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-sofia.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Sofia" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Sofia was the first artist to submit her sample. I didn't fall in love with it, but I felt like if it was the best I got, I'd be okay working with her for the full article.

The animals were anthropomorphized *just* enough to be funny, while still being fun and playful. I think she nailed the expressions. The cat looks kind of snobby, which is fitting for the article because it kind of represents me. The dog is clearly struggling, but not so much that the reader feels bad for him.

## Manel's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Manel Sto Nino](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0146ddb5612a5aaaca)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-manel.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Manel" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Manel's submission was impressive in how *closely* it matched the style of *The Book of Bad Arguments*. Her first sketch was actually even more on the nose, but I asked her to tone it down a bit so that it didn't look like we were egregiously copying that artist.

{% assign fig_caption = "'Appeal to Ignorance,' from [*An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments*](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="boba-appeal-to-ignorance.png" alt="Appeal to Ignorance image" max_width="400px" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

It also had the problem of the bear looking too pitiful.

## Christine's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Christine Elefsiniotis](https://www.facebook.com/christinaillustration/)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-christine.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Chrstine" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Christine's was the most elaborate. There's so much detail, so we learn a lot about the two characters and their pre-existing relationship in this one image. It felt a bit like a New Yorker cartoon, which was maybe a bit more mature than I had in mind. It had the same issue as Manel's in that I kind of felt bad for the frog carrying the couch.

## Winner: Loraine's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Loraine Yow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lolo-ology/)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-loraine.png" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Loraine" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Loraine's submission was the clear winner as soon as I saw it. It was everything I didn't realize I had been looking for the whole time.

I didn't want intricate; I wanted simplicity. I had led the artists astray by referencing *The Book of Bad Arguments* because in that book, the cartoons are the star of the show. In my blog post, I wanted the cartoons to support the text, not the other way around.

It was by far the simplest of the lot, but it was also the most efficient. Like elegant code, it communicated the essential idea and eliminated everything else.

# Working with a cartoonist

## Thinking up concepts

When I got the idea to hire a cartoonist, I thought maybe they would just read my article and make up their own cartoons. That seemed like a win-win because they get creative freedom, I don't have to think up cartoons, and both of us save on communication time.

I asked Loraine if she'd be open to coming up with the concepts herself. said that that would be XX% more per cartoon. I was expecting to spend about $350 on illustrations for the post. That already felt high, so $XX was out of my budget. I'd just come up with my own ideas.

It turned out to be really fun! I got to pretend to be a cartoonist. When I outsourced my cooking to a chef, I realized that I enjoy cooking when I don't have to cook. With this job, I discovered that I enjoy making cartoons when I don't have to draw.

## Describing cartoons is hard

You know that common expression, "A picture's worth is roughly equal to the worth of one thousand words." It turns out to be true. Especially when the thing you're describing is a picture.

## Behind the scenes: The MMA cartoon

>The dog has just finished fighting a shoe in an UFC match. I'm not sure how familiar you are with UFC, but the fights happen in an octagonal ring ([example](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/0e446803915f4de18486c3f16e1f3b93/3d-rendered-illustration-of-an-mma-mixed-martial-arts-fighting-cage-hmfggb.jpg), [example](https://smhttp-ssl-55701.nexcesscdn.net/media/catalog/category/MMAMatCover.jpg)).

>A human referee is holding the dog's paw up in victory. UFC referees wear black pants, black polo shits, and gloves ([example](http://media.ufc.tv/200/UFC200feature_johnmccarthy/GettyImages-115727257.jpg), [example](http://mmatitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/32214_the_usa_today_8412900.0.jpg)).

>So the dog has won, but he has a black eye and some welts as if the shoe hit him back. The shoe is lying on its side on the ground, torn up.

>The cat is in the audience, cheering, "Beautiful grappling! You soundly defeated that shoe." The audience is full but it's just a faceless crowd aside from the cat

I attached this beautiful stick figure drawing:

{% include image.html file="mma-stick-figures.jpg" max_width="600px" alt="My initial stick figure cartoon" img_link=true %}

And Loraine sent me this initial sketch:

{% include image.html file="mma-sketch.png" max_width="600px" alt="Sketch of MMA cartoon" img_link=true %}

Right off the bat, the sketch was pretty close to what I wanted. She sent me a more detailed version and we went a few rounds on minor fixes, but you can see the changes get smaller and smaller as we converge on the final design.

{% include image.html file="mma-v2.png" max_width="400px" alt="MMA cartoon v2" img_link=true %}

# Cost

Compare it to searching for and paying for a stock image. Compare it to the time it takes you to promote the article.

# Tips for hiring cartoonists

I couldn't find any guides to doing this, so I was just making it up as I went along. Afterwards, I reached out to the four cartoonists who I hired for samples, and they all agreed to let me interview them about their experiences working as freelance cartoonists.

Below, I've compiled tips for hiring and working with cartoonists based on the feedback from the cartoonists and from my own experience on that blog post.

## Start with a small job

It's difficult to choose a cartoonist based on only on their portfolios and a brief interview. Instead of investing a lot of time into careful screening, I instead am liberal about screening, but I start off with a very small job that I make clear is a trial job.

A small job also makes it economical to work with several cartoonists redundantly, as I did. I wasn't sure exactly what style I wanted, so this allowed me to see several different options realized fully.

## Attract quality artists

Bad ratings are very damaging to any freelancer's business. The artists are looking for clients who have reasonable expectations and will treat them with respect.

Christine mentioned that a client once began an invitation to apply to a job with, "HEY, YOU. YES, YOU!" If a software recruiter contacted me with a message that began that way, I'd delete their email immediately.

First, you should pay just because it's respectful.

When you expect free samples, you drive away quality artists.

## Write a clear, thorough job description

What size do you need? Do you want just the final images or do you want the raw files as well in case you need to make edits later?


## Consider total cost


## Choose the right contract type for the job

If you have a very firm

If it's loose, pay by the hour.

## Sketch your ideas first

Context didn't matter.

## Give attribution when appropriate

* A published book: Always
* Blog post: It's expected, but not strictly required
* Logos / advertisements: Attribution is not expected

While none of the artists I spoke with said they strictly require it, they all agreed that it was standard to give attribution

## No backsies

Once you accept the work, that's it. The job is over once you approve. If you later notice something wrong or you change your mind, don't expect to get those changes for free.
