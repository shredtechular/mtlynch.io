I had about 8,000 words of text. There were a few tables (ooh, exciting tables!) and screenshots to break it up, but mostly it was a giant wall of text.

I had recently seen an illustrated guide to logical fallacies called [The Book of Bad Arguments](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND). I loved it. It presented dry, academic ideas in a fun, engaging way. I wanted to use cartoons in a similar way to liven up my article.

# Writing the job posting

I received 13 submissions. There were eight men, five women, but 100% of the . I was surprised that it worked out that way, but the pattern I saw was that men's portfolios were like anime, like an X-Men comic book, political cartoons, or a bit gross-out adult, similar to [The Oatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com), who I really like, but is not the style I wanted.

## Thinking up cartoons

When I had the idea of hiring a cartoonist, I thought maybe they would just read my article and make up their own cartoons. That seemed like a win-win because they get creative freedom, I don't have to think up cartoons, and both of us save on communication because I don't have to explain the idea in my head.

Loraine said that that would be XX% more per cartoon. I was expecting to spend about $350 on illustrations for the post. That already felt high, so $XX was out of my budget. I'd just come up with my own ideas.

It turned out to be really fun! I got to pretend to be a cartoonist. When I outsourced my cooking to a chef, I realized that I enjoy cooking when I don't have to cook. With this job, I discovered that I enjoy making cartoons when I don't have to draw.

## Describing cartoons is hard

## Behind the scenes: The MMA cartoon

>The dog has just finished fighting a shoe in an UFC match. I'm not sure how familiar you are with UFC, but the fights happen in an octagonal ring ([example](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/0e446803915f4de18486c3f16e1f3b93/3d-rendered-illustration-of-an-mma-mixed-martial-arts-fighting-cage-hmfggb.jpg), [example](https://smhttp-ssl-55701.nexcesscdn.net/media/catalog/category/MMAMatCover.jpg)).

>A human referee is holding the dog's paw up in victory. UFC referees wear black pants, black polo shits, and gloves ([example](http://media.ufc.tv/200/UFC200feature_johnmccarthy/GettyImages-115727257.jpg), [example](http://mmatitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/32214_the_usa_today_8412900.0.jpg)).

>So the dog has won, but he has a black eye and some welts as if the shoe hit him back. The shoe is lying on its side on the ground, torn up.

>The cat is in the audience, cheering, "Beautiful grappling! You soundly defeated that shoe." The audience is full but it's just a faceless crowd aside from the cat

I attached this beautiful stick figure drawing:

{% include image.html file="mma-stick-figures.jpg" max_width="600px" alt="My initial stick figure cartoon" img_link=true %}

And Loraine sent me this initial sketch:

{% include image.html file="mma-sketch.png" max_width="600px" alt="Sketch of MMA cartoon" img_link=true %}

Right off the bat, the sketch was pretty close to what I wanted. She sent me a more detailed version and we went a few rounds on minor fixes, but you can see the changes get smaller and smaller as we converge on the final design.

# Cost

Compare it to searching for and paying for a stock image. Compare it to the time it takes you to promote the article.

# Tips

I couldn't find any guides to doing this, so I was just making it up as I went along. Afterwards, I reached out to the four cartoonists who I hired for samples, and they all agreed to let me interview them about their experiences working as freelance cartoonists.

Below, I've compiled tips for hiring and working with cartoonists based on the feedback from the cartoonists and from my own experience on that blog post.

## Start with a small job

It's difficult to choose a cartoonist based on only on their portfolios and a brief interview. Instead of investing a lot of time into careful screening, I instead am liberal about screening, but I start off with a very small job that I make clear is a trial job.

A small job also makes it economical to work with several cartoonists redundantly, as I did. I wasn't sure exactly what style I wanted, so this allowed me to see several different options realized fully.

## Attract quality artists

Bad ratings are very damaging to any freelancer's business. The artists are looking for clients who have reasonable expectations and will treat them with respect.

Christine mentioned that a client once began an invitation to apply to a job with, "HEY, YOU. YES, YOU!" If a software recruiter contacted me with a message that began that way, I'd delete their email immediately.

First, you should pay just because it's respectful.

When you expect free samples, you drive away quality artists.

## Write a clear, thorough job description

What size do you need? Do you want just the final images or do you want the raw files as well in case you need to make edits later?


## Consider total cost


## Choose the right contract type for the job

If you have a very firm

If it's loose, pay by the hour.

## Give attribution when appropriate

* A published book: Always
* Blog post: It's expected, but not strictly required
* Logos / advertisements: Attribution is not expected

While none of the artists I spoke with said they strictly require it, they all agreed that it was standard to give attribution

## No backsies

Once you accept the work, that's it. The job is over once you approve. If you later notice something wrong or you change your mind, don't expect to get those changes for free.
