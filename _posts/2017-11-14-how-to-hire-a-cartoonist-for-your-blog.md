I had about 8,000 words of text. There were a few tables (ooh, exciting tables!) and screenshots to break it up, but mostly it was a giant wall of text.

# Feelings

It's fun! I get to pretend to be a cartoonist. I learned with my TaskRabbit chef that I enjoy cooking when I don't have to cook. I enjoy making cartoons when I don't have to draw.

# Themes

## Cartoonists screen their clients carefully

A bad rating is really damaging.
# Tips for hiring a cartoonist
Below, I've compiled tips for hiring and working with cartoonists based on my own experience and interviews with the cartoonists I worked with.

## Start with a small job

First, you should pay just because it's respectful.

When you expect free samples, you drive away quality artists.

## Consider total cost



## Treat the artist with respect

Christine mentioned that a client once began an invitation to apply to a job with, "HEY, YOU. YES, YOU!" If a software recruiter contacted me with a message that began that way, I'd delete their email immediately.

## Choose the right contract type for the job

If you have a very firm

If it's loose, pay by the hour.

## Give attribution

While none of the artists I spoke with said they strictly require it, they all agreed that it was standard to give attribution
